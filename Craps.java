COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

You've made a good start to this program, Sophie, although there
are clearly still some issues with it. Here's a sample run from 
when I tried to play:

    Want to play craps?!
    Y
    Ok YAY! Do you want me to explain the rules?
    Y
    Press <Enter> to roll...First roll: 2
    WOW! You won on the first round congratulations!
    (base) rwhite@Ligne2 Craps-2 % java Craps
    Want to play craps?!
    y
    Ok YAY! Do you want me to explain the rules?
    y
    Press <Enter> to roll...First roll: 10
    Ok, you didn't win or lose yet!
    Your point number is now:10
    Let's move on to the next round
    Press <Enter> to roll...
    Second roll: 4
    Ok, you still didn't win or lose yet!
    Press <Enter> to roll...
    Want to play again?

This doesn't follow the rules of crap, and doesn't include
some of the features that were part of this assignment. We can
take a look at this at some point if you want!

SCORE: 8/15
